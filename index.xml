      <description>The Challenge Any tool, no matter how secure, leaves users vulnerable if it is too difficult to use. Many of the most popular and most critical open source security and privacy tools are maintained and updated by small tool teams with limited exposure to the specific profiles and needs of at-risk users.</description>

      <title>Power to the Users -- From trainings to the UXForum and onwards.</title>
      <link>https://squiggy.github.io/blog/2016-09-15-powertotheusers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, I led a digital security training for independent media in Kyiv during the peak of the EuroMaidan protests. &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/local-voices-global-change/what-good-are-secure-communications-tools-if-no-one-uses-them-690ce2bdf9ec#.hla4lsxya&#34;&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t go as planned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spring, we returned.  We worked with an amazingly skilled trainer who led the local &lt;a href=&#34;https://dss380.org/&#34;&gt;Digital Security School&lt;/a&gt; which had since emerged thanks to the hard work of &lt;a href=&#34;https://equalit.ie/&#34;&gt;eQualit.ie&lt;/a&gt;, and we brought together an amazing community of experts and practitioners who face complex challenges in their work as they dealt with the repercussions of the post-Maidan Ukrainian reality.  This alone would have made for a successful training; but our goal with USABLE is to scale beyond this and get to underlying problems around tool uptake.  So, we also brought a designer (who is now leading frog design&amp;rsquo;s social impact team) and a developer who led a digital security tool that the community was interested in learning more about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://squiggy.github.io/images/blog/uxforum-bigboard.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Notes on strong passwords and laptop security from the UXForum&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: auto;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building this &amp;ldquo;Tool Feedback Training&amp;rdquo; approach to connecting high-risk users and tool developers through the training and design process, and the results we have already achieved, has been an amazing journey.  It may &amp;ndash; and should &amp;ndash; seem simple, but the complexities of making that precise connection is far too often presumed, but not actually done. Real people facing very specific and complex security challenges become an amorphous &amp;ldquo;they.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rdquo; needs many things from constant, bleeding-edge security improvements to changes supporting very specific use cases; but it turns out that if you actually engage the people beyond the &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; - that you learn real, often simple, changes in user experience are the path forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>User Testing in Digital Security Training</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During our first Tool Feedback Training, we faced some natural reluctance to &amp;ldquo;complain&amp;rdquo; about a tool being trained upon, which was magnified by the effect of having a representative from the tool in the training.  To accommodate this, we leveraged the high number of facilitators during each hands-on activity to gather observational data. The trainer would set a short goal (create an account, create a record, share a record), and the participants would work in small groups to accomplish this task, with a facilitator observing each group to note where confusion or problems were occurring.  To balance this with maintaining the flow of the training, the facilitators would keep each group from floundering, and the trainer would review the process for everyone before moving onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protecting High-Risk Tech Users: A Movement for Usability</title>
      <link>https://squiggy.github.io/blog/2016-07-06-protecting-high-risk-users/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting developers with users improves tools for human rights defenders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janvier Hakizimana has a radical idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Governments and large global bodies like the United Nations subsidize new medications to fight disease. Why not also subsidize the adaptation of technology so that it can meet the needs of local communities?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adaptation — making tech tools more open, accessible, and customizable — matters in Janvier’s line of work. He works to support human rights defenders in the East and Horn of Africa who need secure tools to document and report human rights violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://squiggy.github.io/images/blog/usability-secure-apps-screen readers_Credit_Mariel Garcia M.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Testing the usability of secure apps through screen readers, at a USABLE training in Mexico.

&lt;em&gt;Testing the usability of secure apps through screen readers, at a USABLE training in Mexico. Credit: Mariel Garcia M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a tool can’t adapt to local conditions — when it is entirely reliant on an internet connection, for example, users in low-connectivity areas may not be able to use it on a broad scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relying on a hodge-podge of tools that each does one thing well makes work inefficient. Worse, relying on tools that aren’t secure puts high-risk communities in danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Janvier supports human rights defenders, in part as a trainer for USABLE, a project designed to connect high-risk users of digital security and communications tools with the developers who make those tools, in order to make the tools usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, USABLE will hold its first UX Forum in San Francisco, bringing digital security trainers and activists from Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East with developers in the center of US tech development, for three days of hands-on collaboration. USABLE’s focus on human-centered design focuses the process on the real-world needs of activists working on sexual orientation and gender identity rights, media, democracy, and human rights in challenging and threatening environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over at Medium, we just published &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/local-voices-global-change/what-good-are-secure-communications-tools-if-no-one-uses-them-690ce2bdf9ec#.cc36s0g8w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;What Good Are Secure Communications Tools if No One Uses Them?&lt;/a&gt;. This is part of the &amp;ldquo;origin story&amp;rdquo; of the USABLE project, based on a difficult digital security training during the middle of EuroMaidan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning how to balance design and training</title>
      <link>https://squiggy.github.io/blog/2016-01-22-tft/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2016 13:29:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://squiggy.github.io/blog/2016-01-22-tft/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The USABLE team is halfway through our &lt;a href=&#34;https://squiggy.github.io/trainings.html&#34;&gt;Tool Feedback Training&lt;/a&gt; process, and the first two TFTs were hugely informative. We worked with groups doing amazing work while facing widely different challenges; including censorship, targeted malware, and situations where digital security problems can become physical security ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns we had going in to this process was balancing the digital security training for the participants with human-centered design exercises, which is why we spent so much time working through this during our &lt;a href=&#34;https://squiggy.github.io/2015/11/20/securitydesigworkshop.html&#34;&gt;Security and Design Workshop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both trainings however, the participants not only responded enthusiastically to the design exercises we conducted, but expressed ongoing interest in applying design thinking to their project work. The design-centric agenda items have actually meshed well with the digital security curricula, engaging participants in the design process, creating users personas, and supporting the tool developers in coming up with prototyped design changes. We&amp;rsquo;ll post soon on building user testing directly in to the training process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dSchool&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/4dbb2/The_Wallet_Project.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wallet Exercise&lt;/a&gt; has been very useful as a short, fun way to get into the mindset of design, as it leads you through a series of thought, listening, and feedback exercises with a partner. It - along with many of the other design exercises &amp;ndash; creates a great icebreaker effect by putting everyone on the same level as they work through a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve updated the &lt;a href=&#34;https://squiggy.github.io/trainings.html#schedule&#34;&gt;TFT schedule&lt;/a&gt; to better reflect how these first TFTs went - you&amp;rsquo;ll see a back-and-forth between threat modeling, design exercises, and tool trainings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Training and Design</title>
      <link>https://squiggy.github.io/blog/2015-11-21-sdworkshop-trainings-and-design/</link>

      <guid>https://squiggy.github.io/blog/2015-11-21-sdworkshop-trainings-and-design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&#34;https://squiggy.github.io/2015/11/20/securitydesigworkshop.html&#34;&gt;Security and Design Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, we realized that our original plan of book-ending a classic digital security training with human centered design exercises was not ideal &amp;ndash; many elements of learning and exploration that are key to training are similarly core to collaborative design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test this out, we spent one afternoon running a digital security training on mobile security. We based the training on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.level-up.cc/resources-for-trainers/pedagogical-resources/adult-learners&#34;&gt;ADIDS adult-learning approach&lt;/a&gt;, and used a selection of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.level-up.cc&#34;&gt;Level Up curricula&lt;/a&gt; components, integrating human-centered design components into the flow of the training.  The rest of this post will run through the components of the training and the outcomes from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The USABLE project is built around a core commitment to listen - to users, to trainers, and to our partners.  As we began assembling the team of amazing designers and usability experts we are working with, a common thread emerged around a desire to connect and frame their inputs as usability experts for the digital security space and map out how they would engage during the tool feedback trainings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were able to bring together a Security and Design Workshop in mid November, thanks to the amazing generosity and flexibility of our partners and hosted in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&amp;rsquo; new San Francisco offices&lt;/a&gt;. This gave the USABLE team a chance to go over operational security concerns for working with vulnerable populations and let the designers experience firsthand both some of the digital security tools we hope to work with, and the process of a digital security training. More importantly, however, was the chance to really dig in to our plans for integrating need-finding and human centered design into the digital security training process to create the &amp;ldquo;Tool Feedback Trainings&amp;rdquo; (TFTs) we envision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For needfinding, USABLE is integrating core aspects of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://internetfreedom.secondmuse.com/needfinding/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SecondMuse&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Internet Freedom Need Finding Toolkit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into this process to supplement our pre-training interview and engagement processes with our local partners and trainers. Members from the SecondMuse team were able to join us and help us work through their framework and adapt it to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://squiggy.github.io/2015/10/09/announcing-usable.html&#34;&gt;Tool Feedback Training model in USABLE&lt;/a&gt;.  This helped us discover what information is valuable to match a community with a tool developer, as well as understanding the threats and capacity of each community that goes into digital security trainings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://squiggy.github.io/images/blog/designworkshop-process.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;USABLE&#39;s TFT process evolves&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; height: auto;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the workshop, we worked on integrating HCD practices into the training process.  The final day began with a series of human centered design exercises led by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; that would be adaptable for the TFT scenarios, from introductory exercises to more practical ones, such as having participants design the training or manual for a tool as a way to focus the tool&amp;rsquo;s actual interface on those aspects that truly require training, as opposed to those which could be set to secure defaults, automated, or provided as &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; options.&lt;/p&gt;

USABLE, a project of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.internews.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Internews&lt;/a&gt;, brings a human centered design lens to digital security tools through a three-phase process (detailed out below) with add-on benefits of producing community-led user personas, connecting tool developers with trainers and at-risk users, and encouraging sharing of design patterns and usability challenges along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re just getting started and are locking in our first communities, and expect to be running these needs-based trainings throughout early 2016. We will be sharing the user personas and learnings from these trainings over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
